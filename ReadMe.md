# DevOps Hack Essentials 2018 - Guidance
This content is intended to be used for a led lab provided by Microsoft.

The intent is to provide a hands-on experience with Azure DevOps. Most challenges are operating system agnostic, and can be accomplished within a browser or using a Git client.

You can find all challenges in [this][1] document.

Here'show it works:
1. Find a bunch of colleagues to build a team and work together. (Ideally you form a team of 2-5 people.)
1. Go read the [challenges document][1].
1. Tackle the challenges one by one.
1. If you need help, check the hints documents linked in the challenges docs. You will find screenshots and information there to guide you.
1. If you need more help ask an instructor.

Note:
The documents containing hints are not step-by-step guides as you might expect. We want you to explore and get to know the tools, so they provide what we hope is just enough guidance.
If you need more assistance, please ask an instructor.  

So now, get started and good luck with [all the challenges!][1]
